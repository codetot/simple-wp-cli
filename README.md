# Simple WP CLI

This simple WP CLI plugin helps you add some useful queries which are not available in default WP CLI.


## Commands

```
wp tag delete --count=1 --number=300
```

- `count`: how many posts are assigned to tag (0 or 1 is great to delete)
- `number`: how many tags should be delete once
